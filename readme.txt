# Work

## Bresenham

Implementation of Bresenham's algorithm. Lines are drawn in the center of screen and lines cutting is implemented using Cohen Sutherland's algorithm. With left mouse button you determine two points and with right mouse button lines are drawn only in the screen center.

## Polygons

Create a polygon with left mouse button and fill it with right mouse button.

## Triangles

Drawing filled triangles using OpenGL VAO, VBO and EBO.

## Wired model

Wired model of robot's head.

## OpenGL camera

Implementation of model, view and projection matrices. User can move his eye vector using keys Q, W, E, A, S, D.

## Removing hidden polygons 

Backface culling. Three different algorithms used

## Bezier curve

Eye is moving on Bezier's curve. User can set polygon's points using left mouse button and moving with Q,W,E,A,S,D.
